# compiler-design-eth-tests
Shared tests for the compiler design projects, HS21.

## Use

The repository contains a copy of the tests I personally use for the projects.
Each folder contains a whole copy of the file where we can write our own tests.

To use them, you can simply replace the whole *studenttests.ml* with the one provided here.

## Contribute

Please, if you find any problem or bug in the provided tests, open an *issue*.
If you know how to fix them, you can also go ahead and open a PR with the fix.

If you have some other tests you have already written, you can either open a PR or contact me.
In any case, I will keep an eye at the course's forum in orther to gather all tests that are published there.
